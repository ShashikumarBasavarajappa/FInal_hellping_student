step1 day,

* hibernate  means the logoff from this
* ORM Based application

This should be usefull when we are doing the secured

Hibernate will help in DAO part(Data access object)

If we go through the JDBC what will happen we will check easily

EJB will not give Secure code for the things
prevously IF we made multi user action then it's failing for multi user_id

EJB session and EJB entity class we can make the BUSINESS AND DAO class

Application server -> JBOSS, Glasss fish server , Web logic

Switching the Database in the hibernate it's easy


example for facebook

first time login it will take 10 minutes so it take time to refresh

next time onwards it will load in the seconds

EJB Query launguage is there, it will create the object from that we can use that object, then which are the DB changed also we can
do it easily

Enterpricess application   simple query idea will not required,

NOrmal procedure,

JDBC query you wrote then we need that
server to read the class data based on the fields

TO overcome all the issue we developed the HIBERnate
