 <p><strong>Health Service Psychology.</strong></p> <p>The program offers broad and general doctoral education and training that includes preparation in health service psychology (HSP). Although HSP encompasses a range of practice areas, degree types, and career paths, certain elements are common to training in the profession. A program that is accredited in health service psychology must demonstrate that it contains the following elements:</p> <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> Integration of empirical evidence and practice: Practice is evidence-based, and evidence is practice-informed.<br></li> <li> Training is sequential, cumulative, graded in complexity, and designed to prepare students for practice or further organized training.<br></li> <li> The program engages in actions that indicate respect for and understanding of cultural and individual differences and diversity.</li>  </ol>
<p><strong>Practice Area.</strong></p> <p>Health service psychology includes several practice areas in which an accredited program may focus, including the areas of clinical psychology, counseling psychology, school psychology, combinations of these areas, and other developed practice areas. </p>
<p><strong>Administrative Structure.</strong></p> <p>The program's purpose must be pursued in an institutional setting appropriate for doctoral education and training in health service psychology. The institution must have a clear administrative structure and commitment to the doctoral program.</p> <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> The sponsoring institution of higher education must be authorized under applicable law or other acceptable authority to provide a program of postsecondary education and have appropriate graduate degree-granting authority. This includes state authorization and accreditation of the institution by a nationally recognized regional accrediting body in the United States. <br></li> <li> The program is an integral part of the mission of the academic department, college, school, or institution in which it resides. It is represented in the institution's operating budget and plans in a manner that supports the training mission of the program. Funding and resources are stable and enable the program to achieve its aims.</li> </ol>
<p><strong>Administrative Responsibilities Related to Cultural and Individual Differences and Diversity.</strong></p>  <p>The program recognizes the importance of cultural and individual differences and diversity in the training of psychologists. The Commission on Accreditation defines cultural and individual differences and diversity as including, but not limited to, age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, language, national origin, race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. The program has made systematic, coherent, and long-term efforts to attract and retain students and faculty from diverse backgrounds into the program. Consistent with such efforts, it acts to ensure a supportive and encouraging learning environment appropriate for the training of individuals who are diverse and the provision of training opportunities for a broad spectrum of individuals. Further, the program avoids any actions that would restrict program access on grounds that are irrelevant to success in graduate training, either directly or by imposing significant and disproportionate burdens on the basis of the personal and demographic characteristics set forth in the definition of cultural diversity. Because of the United States' rich diverse higher education landscape, training can take place in both secular and faith-based settings. Thus this requirement does not exclude programs from having a religious affiliation or purpose and adopting and applying admission and employment policies that directly relate to this affiliation or purpose, so long as public notice of these policies has been made to applicants, students, faculty, and staff before their application or affiliation with the program. These policies may provide a preference for persons adhering to the religious purpose or affiliation of the program, but they shall not be used to preclude the admission, hiring, or retention of individuals because of the personal and demographic characteristics set forth under the definition of cultural diversity. This provision is intended to permit religious policies as to admission, retention, and employment only to the extent that they are protected by the U.S. Constitution. This provision will be administered as if the U.S. Constitution governed its application. Notwithstanding the above, and regardless of a program's setting, the program may not constrain academic freedom or otherwise alter the requirements of these standards. Finally, compelling pedagogical interests require that each program prepare graduates to navigate cultural and individual differences in research and practice, including those that may produce value conflicts or other tensions arising from the intersection of different areas of diversity.</p>
<p><strong>Program Administration and Structure </strong></p>  <ol type="a" start="1">  <li><strong>Program Leadership.</strong> The program has consistent and stable leadership with a designated leader who is a doctoral-level psychologist and a member of the core faculty. The program leader's credentials and expertise must be in an area covered by HSP accreditation and must be consistent with the program's aims. This leadership position may be held by more than one individual. <br></li>  <li><strong>Program Administration.</strong> The program has designated procedures and personnel responsible for making decisions about the program, including curriculum, student selection and evaluation, and program maintenance and improvement. The program's decision-making procedures, including who is involved in decision making, must be consistent with the missions of the institution and department, and with the program's aims. The program ensures a stable educational environment through its personnel and faculty leadership.</li>   </ol>
<p><strong>Length of Degree and Residency. </strong></p>  <p>The program has policies regarding program length and residency that permit faculty, training staff, supervisors, and administrators to execute their professional, ethical, and potentially legal obligations to promote student development, socialization and peer interaction, faculty role modeling and the development and assessment of student competencies. Residency provides students with mentoring and supervision regarding their development and socialization into the profession, as well as continuous monitoring and assessment of student development through live face-to-face, in-person interaction with faculty and students. These obligations cannot be met in programs that are substantially or completely online. At a minimum, the program must require that each student successfully complete:</p>    <ol type="a" start="1">  <li> a minimum of 3 full-time academic years of graduate study (or the equivalent thereof) plus an internship prior to receiving the doctoral degree;<br></li>  <li> at least 2 of the 3 academic training years (or the equivalent thereof) within the program from which the doctoral degree is granted;<br></li>  <li> at least 1 year of which must be in full-time residence (or the equivalent thereof) at that same program. Programs seeking to satisfy the requirement of one year of full-time residency based on "the equivalent thereof" must demonstrate how the proposed equivalence achieves all the purposes of the residency requirement. </li>   </ol>
<p><strong>Partnerships/Consortia. </strong></p> <p>A graduate program may consist of, or be located under, a single administrative entity (e.g., institution, agency, school, or department) or in a partnership or consortium among separate administrative entities. A consortium is comprised of multiple independently administered entities that have, in writing, formally agreed to pool resources to conduct a training or education program. </p>
<p><strong>Resources. </strong></p> <p>The program has, and appropriately utilizes, the resources it needs to achieve its training aims, including student acquisition and demonstration of competencies. The program works with its academic unit and/or the administration of the sponsor institution to develop a plan for the acquisition of additional resources that may be necessary for program maintenance and development. The resources should include the following:</p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> financial support for training and educational activities;<br></li> <li> clerical, technical, and electronic support;<br></li> <li> training materials and equipment;<br></li> <li> physical facilities; <br></li> <li> services to support students with academic, financial, health, and personal issues;<br></li> <li> sufficient and appropriate practicum experiences to allow a program to effectively achieve the program's training aims.</li>  </ol>
<p><strong>Areas of Coverage. </strong></p> <p>The program has and adheres to formal written policies and procedures that govern students as they enter, progress through, and matriculate from the program. These must include policies relevant to:</p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> academic recruitment and admissions, including general recruitment/admissions and recruitment of students who are diverse. <br></li> <li> degree requirements; <br></li> <li> administrative and financial assistance;<br></li>  <li> student performance evaluation, feedback, advisement, retention, and termination decisions; <br></li> <li> due process and grievance procedures;<br></li> <li> student rights, responsibilities, and professional development;<br></li> <li> nondiscrimination policies. The program must document nondiscriminatory policies and operating conditions and avoidance of any actions that would restrict program access or completion on grounds that are irrelevant to success in graduate training or the profession. </li>  </ol>
<p><strong>Implementation. </strong></p> <p>All policies and procedures used by the program must be consistent with the profession's current ethics code and must adhere to their sponsor institution's regulations and local, state, and federal statutes regarding due process and fair treatment. If the program utilizes policies developed at another level (e.g., department or institution), it must demonstrate how it implements these policies at the program level.</p>
<p><strong>Availability of Policies and Procedures. </strong></p> <p>The program makes the formal written policies and procedures available to all interested parties. By the time of matriculation, the program provides students with written policies and procedures regarding program and institution requirements and expectations regarding students' performance and continuance in the program and procedures for the termination of students. </p>
<p><strong>Record Keeping. </strong></p> <p>The program is responsible for keeping information and records related to student training and complaints/grievances against the program. Records must be maintained in accord with federal, state, and institution policies regarding record keeping and privacy. The Commission on Accreditation will examine student records and programs' records of student complaints as part of its periodic review of programs. </p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li><strong>Student Records.</strong> The program must document and maintain accurate records of each student's education and training experiences and evaluations for evidence of the student's progression through the program, as well as for future reference and credentialing purposes. The program should inform students of its records retention policies. <br></li> <li> <strong> Complaints/Grievances.</strong> The program must keep records of all formal complaints and grievances of which it is aware that have been submitted or filed against the program and/or against individuals associated with the program since its last accreditation site visit. The Commission on Accreditation will examine a program's records of student complaints as part of its periodic review of the program. </li>  </ol>
<p>Additional Information relevant to Section I</p>
<p><strong>Aims of the Program</strong></p>  <ol type="1" start="1"> <li> The program must provide information on the aims of its training program that are consistent with health service psychology as defined by these standards, the program's area of psychology, and the degree conferred.<br></li> <li> These aims should reflect the program's approach to training and the outcomes the program targets for its graduates, including the range of targeted career paths.</li>  </ol>
<p><strong>Discipline-Specific Knowledge, Profession-Wide Competencies, and Learning/Curriculum Elements Required by the Profession Discipline-specific knowledge and profession-wide competencies </strong></p>  <p>1. Discipline-specific knowledge serves as a cornerstone for the establishment of identity in and orientation to health services psychology. Thus, all students in accredited programs should acquire a general knowledge base in the field of psychology, broadly construed, to serve as a foundation for further training in the practice of health service psychology.</p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> Discipline-specific knowledge represents the requisite core knowledge of psychology an individual must have to attain the profession-wide competencies. Programs may elect to demonstrate discipline-specific knowledge of students by:   <ol class="lower-roman" type="i" start="1">  <li> Using student selection criteria that involve standardized assessments of a foundational knowledge base (e.g., GRE subject tests). In this case, the program must describe how the curriculum builds upon this foundational knowledge to enable students to demonstrate graduate level discipline-specific knowledge.<br></li> <li> Providing students with broad exposure to discipline-specific knowledge. In this case, the program is not required to demonstrate that students have specific foundational knowledge at entry but must describe how the program's curriculum enables students to demonstrate graduate-level discipline-specific knowledge.</li>  </ol></li>  </ol>
<p>Profession-wide competencies include certain competencies required for all students who graduate from programs accredited in health service psychology. Programs must provide opportunities for all of their students to achieve and demonstrate each required profession-wide competency. Although in general, the competencies appearing at or near the top of the following list serve as foundations upon which later competencies are built, each competency is considered critical for graduates in programs accredited in health service psychology. The specific requirements for each competency are articulated in Implementing Regulations. Because science is at the core of health service psychology, programs must demonstrate that they rely on the current evidence-base when training students in the following competency areas. Students must demonstrate competence in: </p>    <ol class="lower-roman" type="i" start="1">  <li> Research<br></li>  <li> Ethical and legal standards<br></li>  <li> Individual and cultural diversity<br></li>  <li> Professional values, attitudes, and behaviors<br></li>  <li> Communication and interpersonal skills<br></li>  <li> Assessment<br></li>  <li> Intervention<br></li>  <li> Supervision <br></li>  <li> Consultation and interprofessional/interdisciplinary skills</li>   </ol>
<p><strong>Learning/Curriculum Elements Related to the program's Aims. </strong></p> <p>The program must describe the process by which students attain discipline-specific knowledge and each profession-wide competency (i.e., the program's curriculum) and provide a description of how the curriculum is consistent with professional standards and the program's aims.</p> 
<p><strong>Required Practicum Training Elements</strong></p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> Practicum must include supervised experience working with diverse individuals with a variety of presenting problems, diagnoses, and issues. The purpose of practicum is to develop the requisite knowledge and skills for graduates to be able to demonstrate the competencies defined above. The doctoral program needs to demonstrate that it provides a training plan applied and documented at the individual level, appropriate to the student's current skills and ability, that ensures that by the time the student applies for internship the student has attained the requisite level of competency.<br></li> <li> Programs must place students in settings that are committed to training, that provide experiences that are consistent with health service psychology and the program's aims, and that enable students to attain and demonstrate appropriate competencies.<br></li> <li> Supervision must be provided by appropriately trained and credentialed individuals.<br></li> <li> As part of a program's ongoing commitment to ensuring the quality of their graduates, each practicum evaluation must be based in part on direct observation of the practicum student and her/his developing skills (either live or electronically).</li>  </ol>
<p><strong>4. Required Internship Training Elements. </strong></p> <p>The program must demonstrate that all students complete a one year full-time or two year part-time internship. The program's policies regarding student placement at accredited versus unaccredited internships should be consistent with national standards regarding internship training. </p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li><strong> Accredited Internships.</strong> Students are expected to apply for, and to the extent possible, complete internship training programs that are either APA- or CPA-accredited. For students who attend accredited internships, the doctoral program is required to provide only the specific name of the internship.<br></li> <li><strong> Unaccredited Internships.</strong> When a student attends an unaccredited internship, it is the responsibility of the doctoral program to provide evidence demonstrating quality and adequacy of the internship experience. This must include information on the following:   <ol class="lower-roman" type="i" start="1"> <li> the nature and appropriateness of the training activities;<br></li> <li> frequency and quality of supervision; <br></li> <li> credentials of the supervisors; <br></li> <li> how the internship evaluates student performance; <br></li> <li> how interns demonstrate competency at the appropriate level; <br></li> <li> documentation of the evaluation of its students in its student files. </li>  </ol></li></ol>
<p><strong>Degree Type. </strong></p> <p>All accredited programs in psychology support the development of disciplinary knowledge and core competencies associated with the profession, and support the acquisition and integration of knowledge, skills, and attitudes from two major domains within the discipline: research and evidence-based practice. Programs are accredited either to offer the PhD degree or to offer the PsyD degree. Other doctoral degree designations that meet these general parameters may be eligible for consideration as appropriate. Although all doctoral degrees contain all the required elements common to programs accredited in HSP, they differ in the balance among, and relative emphasis on, program components, based on specific training aims or likely career paths of their graduates.</p> <p>In general, PhD programs place relatively greater emphasis upon training related to research, and PsyD programs place relatively greater emphasis on training for engaging in professional practice. Graduates of each type of program or other doctoral degree designations, however, must demonstrate a fundamental understanding of and competency in both research/scholarly activities and evidence-based professional practice.</p> <p>Programs that confer the PhD must have a substantial proportion of faculty who conduct empirical research in the discipline (or related disciplines and fields) and a substantial proportion of faculty who have been trained for the practice of psychology. Thus, students in PhD programs are trained to both create and disseminate the scholarly research upon which science and practice are built, as well as utilize such research to engage in evidence-based practice.</p> <p>Programs that confer the PsyD must have a substantial proportion of faculty who engage in scholarship and/or empirical research in the discipline (or related disciplines and fields) and a substantial proportion of faculty who have been trained for the practice of psychology. Thus, students in PsyD programs are trained to engage in evidence-based practice, as well as in scientific inquiry and evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Program-Specific Competencies and Related Curriculum. </strong></p> <p>Doctoral programs accredited in health service psychology may require that students attain additional competencies specific to the program. </p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> If the program requires additional competencies of its students, it must describe the competencies, how they are consistent with the program's aims, and the process by which students attain each competency (i.e., curriculum).<br></li> <li> Additional competencies must be consistent with the ethics of the profession.</li>  </ol>
<p><strong>Evaluation of Students' Competencies.</strong></p>  <p>The program must evaluate students' competencies in both profession-defined and program-defined areas. By the time of degree completion, each student must demonstrate achievement of both the profession-wide competencies and those required by the program. Thus, for each competency, the program must:</p>    <ol class="lower-roman" type="i" start="1">  <li> Specify how it evaluates student performance, and the minimum level of achievement or performance required of the student to demonstrate competency. Programs must demonstrate how their evaluation methods and minimum levels of achievement are appropriate for the measurement of each competency. The level of achievement expected should reflect the current standards for the profession.<br></li>  <li> Provide outcome data that clearly demonstrate that by the time of degree completion, all students have reached the appropriate level of achievement in each profession-wide competency as well as in each program-defined competency. While the program has flexibility in deciding what outcome data to present, the data should reflect assessment that is consistent with best practices in student competency evaluation.</li>  <li> Present formative and summative evaluations linked to exit criteria, as well as data demonstrating achievement of competencies, for each student in the program.</li>   </ol>
<p>For program graduates, the program must provide distal evidence of students' competencies and program effectiveness and must evaluate graduates' career paths in health service psychology after they have left the program.</p>    <ol class="lower-roman" type="i" start="1">  <li> Two years after graduation, the program must provide data on how well the program prepared students in each profession-wide and program-specific competency. The program must also provide data on students' job placement and licensure rates.</li>  <li> At 5 years post-graduation, the program must provide data on graduates, including data on graduates' licensure (as appropriate for their current job duties) and their scholarly/research contributions (as consistent with the program's aims).</li>   </ol>
<p><strong>Evaluation of Program Effectiveness and Quality Improvement Efforts</strong></p>    <ol type="a" start="1">  <li> The program must demonstrate a commitment to ensure competence in health service psychology through ongoing self-evaluation in order to monitor its performance and contribution to the fulfilment of its sponsor institution's mission.<br></li>  <li> The program must document mechanisms for engaging in regular, ongoing self-assessment that:  <ol class="lower-roman" type="i" start="1">  <li> Involves program stakeholders, including faculty, students, graduates, and others involved in the training program.<br></li>  <li> Evaluates its effectiveness in training students who, by the time of graduation, demonstrate the competencies required by the profession and the program, and who after graduation are able to engage in professional activities consistent with health service psychology and with the program's aims.</li>  <li> Evaluates the currency and appropriateness of its aims, curriculum, and policies and procedures with respect to the following: its sponsor institution's mission and goals; local, state/provincial, regional, and national needs for psychological services; national standards for health service psychology; and the evolving evidence base of the profession.</li>  <li> Identifies potential areas for improvement. </li> </ol></li></ol>
<p><strong>Documenting and Achieving Outcomes Demonstrating Program's Effectiveness. </strong></p> <p>All accredited doctoral programs are expected to document student achievement while in the program and to look at post-graduation outcomes. Accredited programs are also expected to prepare students for entry-level practice and the program's achievement of this should be reflected in student success in achieving licensure after completion of the program.</p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> The outcomes of program graduates including licensure rate and other proximal and distal outcomes of program graduates shall be evaluated within the context of: the requirement that all accredited doctoral programs prepare students for entry-level practice; each program's expressed and implied stated educational aims and competencies; and statements made by the program to the public. <br></li> <li> Doctoral programs' specific educational aims and expected competencies may differ from one another; therefore there is no specified threshold or minimum number for reviewing a program's licensure rate. Instead the Commission on Accreditation shall use its professional judgment to determine if the program's licensure rate, in combination with other factors, such as attrition of students from the program and their time to degree, demonstrates students' successful preparation for entry-level practice in health service psychology.</li> </ol>
<p>Additional information relevant to Section II.</p>
<p><strong>Student Selection Processes and Criteria</strong></p>    <p>The program has an identifiable body of students at different levels of matriculation who:</p>     <ol type="a" start="1">  <li> constitute a number that allows opportunities for meaningful peer interaction, support, and socialization.</li>  <li> are reflective of a systematic, multiple-year plan, implemented and sustained over time, designed to attract students from a range of diverse backgrounds as outlined in the Glossary.</li>    <ol class="lower-roman" type="i" start="1">  <li> The program must implement specific activities, approaches, and initiatives to increase diversity among its students. It may participate in institutional-level initiatives aimed toward achieving diversity, but these alone are not sufficient.<br></li>  <li> The program should document the concrete actions it is taking to achieve diversity, identifying the areas of diversity recruitment in which it excels as well as the areas in which it is working to improve. The program should demonstrate that it examines the effectiveness of its efforts to attract students who are diverse and document any steps needed to revise/enhance its strategies.</li> </ol></ol>   <ol type="a" start="3">  <li> By prior achievement, students have demonstrated appropriate competency for the program's aims as well as expectations for a doctoral program.<br></li>    <ol class="lower-roman" type="i" start="1">  <li> If the program has criteria for selection that involve demonstration of prior knowledge (e.g., GRE subject tests), the program must discuss how these criteria influence program requirements, are appropriate for the aims of the program, and maximize student success.</li>  <li> If the program has broad entrance criteria (e.g., undergraduate or graduate GPA), the program must address how students will be prepared for advanced education and training in psychology, how the curriculum is structured in accord with the goal of graduate-level competency, and how the criteria relative to the curriculum maximize student success.</li></ol> </ol>   <ol type="a" start="4">  <li> By interest and aptitude, they are prepared to meet the program's aims.</li>  <li> They reflect, through their intellectual and professional development and intended career paths, the program's aims and philosophy. </li>   </ol>
<p><strong>Supportive Learning Environment</strong></p>  <p>Program faculty are accessible to students and provide them with guidance and supervision. They serve as appropriate professional role models and engage in actions that promote the students' acquisition of knowledge, skills, and competencies consistent with the program's training aims. </p>
<p>The program recognizes the rights of students and faculty to be treated with courtesy and respect. In order to maximize the quality and effectiveness of students' learning experiences, all interactions among students, faculty, and staff should be collegial and conducted in a manner that reflects the highest standards of the scholarly community and of the profession (see the current APA Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct). The program has an obligation to inform students of these principles, put procedures in place to promote productive interactions, and inform students of their avenues of recourse should problems with regard to them arise. </p>
<p>To ensure a supportive and encouraging learning environment for students who are diverse, the program must avoid any actions that would restrict program access on grounds that are irrelevant to success in graduate training. </p>
<p><strong>Plans to Maximize Student Success</strong></p>  <p>Program faculty engage in and document actions and procedures that actively encourage timely completion of the program and maximize student success. The program minimizes preventable causes of attrition (e.g., flawed admission procedures or unsupportive learning environments) and engages in tailored retention/completion efforts as appropriate (e.g., accommodation of student needs and special circumstances).</p>
<p><strong>Program Engagement. </strong></p> <p>The program engages in specific activities, approaches, and initiatives to implement and maintain diversity and ensure a supportive learning environment for all students. The program may participate in institutional-level initiatives aimed toward retaining students who are diverse, but these alone are not sufficient. Concrete program-level actions to retain students who are diverse should be integrated across key aspects of the program and should be documented. The program should also demonstrate that it examines the effectiveness of its efforts to retain students who are diverse and document any steps needed to revise/enhance its strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback and Remediation. </strong></p> <p>Students receive, at least annually and as the need is observed for it, written feedback on the extent to which they are meeting the program's requirements and performance expectations. Such feedback should include:</p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> timely, written notification of any problems that have been noted and the opportunity to discuss them;<br></li> <li> guidance regarding steps to remediate any problems (if remediable);<br></li> <li> substantive, written feedback on the extent to which corrective actions have or have not been successful in addressing the issues of concern. </li>  </ol>
<p>Additional information relevant to Section III.</p>
<p>Leadership of the program is stable. There is a designated leader who is a doctoral-level psychologist and a member of the core faculty. The program leader's credentials and expertise are consistent with the program's mission and aims and with the substantive area of health service psychology in which the program provides training. More than one individual can hold this leadership position.</p>
<p>The program leader(s) together with program core faculty have primary responsibility for the design, implementation, and evaluation of the program's administrative activities (e.g., policies and procedures for student admissions, student evaluations, and arrangement of practicum experiences) and for its educational offerings (e.g., coursework, practicum experiences, and research training). </p>
<p><strong>FacultyQualifications and Role Modeling</strong></p>  <p><strong>1. Core Faculty.</strong> The program has an identifiable core faculty responsible for the program's activities, educational offerings, and quality, who: </p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> function as an integral part of the academic unit of which the program is an element;<br></li> <li> are sufficient in number for their academic and professional responsibilities; <br></li> <li> have theoretical perspectives and academic and applied experiences appropriate to the program's aims;<br></li> <li> demonstrate substantial competence and have recognized credentials in those areas that are at the core of the program's aims;<br></li> <li> are available to function as appropriate role models for students in their learning and socialization into the discipline and profession. <br></li> </ol> <p><strong>2. Additional Core Faculty Professional Characteristics </strong></p> <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> Core faculty must be composed of individuals whose education, training, and/or experience are consistent with their roles in the program in light of the substantive area in which the program seeks accreditation.<br></li> <li> Core faculty must be composed of individuals whose primary professional employment (50% or more) is at the institution in which the program is housed, and to whom the institution has demonstrated a multiyear commitment. At least 50% of core faculty professional time must be devoted to program-related activities.<br></li> <li> Core faculty must be identified with the program and centrally involved in program development, decision making, and student training. "Identified with the program" means that each faculty member is included in public and departmental documents as such, views himself or herself as core faculty, and is seen as core faculty by the students. <br></li> <li> Core faculty activities directly related to the doctoral program include program-related teaching, research, scholarship, and/or professional activities; supervising students' research, students' dissertations, and students' teaching activities; mentoring students' professional development; providing clinical supervision; monitoring student outcomes; teaching in a master's degree program that is an integral part of the doctoral program; and developing, evaluating, and maintaining the program.</li> </ol>  <p>Core faculty activities not directly related to the doctoral program and not seen as aspects of the core faculty role include undergraduate teaching in general and related activities; teaching and related activities in terminal master's or other graduate programs; and clinical work or independent practice not directly associated with training, such as at a counseling center.</p>
<p><strong>Associated and Adjunct Faculty.</strong> In addition to core faculty, programs may also have associated program faculty, contributing faculty, and adjunct (visiting, auxiliary, or "other") faculty. Associated program faculty do not meet the criteria for core faculty. They are not centrally involved in program development and decision making, but they still make a substantial contribution to the program and take on some of the tasks often associated with core faculty. Adjunct faculty are hired on an ad hoc basis to teach one or two courses, provide supervision, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Faculty Sufficiency</strong></p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> Consistent with the program's model, the program faculty, and in particular the core faculty, needs to be large enough to advise and supervise students' research and practice, conduct research and/or engage in scholarly activity, attend to administrative duties, serve on institutional or program committees, provide a sense of program continuity, provide appropriate class sizes and sufficient course offerings to meet program aims, and monitor and evaluate practicum facilities, internship settings, and student progress. <br></li> <li> The program faculty, and in particular the core faculty, needs to be large enough to support student engagement and success within the program, from admissions, to matriculation, to timely completion of program requirements and graduation.<br></li> <li> At least one member of the core faculty needs to hold professional licensure as a psychologist to practice in the jurisdiction in which the program is located.<br></li> <li> The program faculty must themselves be engaged in activities demonstrating the skills they are endeavoring to teach their students, such as delivering psychological services, conducting psychological research, publishing scholarly work, presenting professional work at conferences/meetings, teaching classes/workshops, and supervising the professional work of others.</li> </ol>
<p><strong>Recruitment of Faculty who are Diverse. </strong></p> <p>Each accredited program is responsible for making systematic, coherent, and long-term efforts to attract (i.e., recruit) and retain faculty from differing backgrounds. The program has developed a systematic, long-term plan to attract faculty from a range of diverse backgrounds and implemented it when possible (i.e., when there have been faculty openings). The program may participate in institutional-level initiatives aimed toward achieving diversity, but these alone are not sufficient. The program should document concrete actions it has taken to achieve diversity, addressing the areas of diversity recruitment in which it excels as well as the areas in which it is working to improve. It should demonstrate that it examines the effectiveness of its efforts to attract faculty who are diverse and document any steps needed to revise/enhance its strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Retention of Faculty who are Diverse. </strong></p> <p>The program has program specific activities, approaches, and initiatives it implements to maintain diversity among its faculty. A program may include institutional-level initiatives aimed toward retaining faculty who are diverse, but these alone are not sufficient. The program demonstrates that it examines the effectiveness of its efforts to maintain faculty who are diverse and documents any steps needed to revise/enhance its strategies.</p>
<p>Additional information relevant to Section IV.</p>
<p><strong>General Disclosures</strong></p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> The program demonstrates its commitment to public disclosure by providing clearly presented written materials and other communications that appropriately represent it to all relevant publics.

<p>Additional information relevant to Section V.</p>
<p><strong>Areas of Postdoctoral Accreditation.</strong></p> <p>Programs providing training in health service psychology (HSP) may be accredited in one or more areas: </p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> Advanced competencies in the major areas of training in health service psychology that are recognized within the scope of accreditation (i.e., clinical, counseling, school, and other developed practice areas). <br> A focus area that promotes attainment of advanced competencies in a context within one or more of the major areas of training in health service psychology that are recognized within the scope of accreditation (i.e., clinical, counseling, school, and other developed practice areas).<br></li> <li> Specialty practice areas in health service psychology. If accreditation is sought in a recognized specialty practice area, the specialty practice area must meet at least two of the following requirements:   <ol class="lower-roman" type="i" start="1"> <li> The specialty is recognized by the Commission on the Recognition of Specialties and Proficiencies in Professional Psychology (CRSPPP) of the American Psychological Association or by the American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP).<br></li>    <li> The specialty is recognized by and holds membership on the Council of Specialties (CoS).<br></li>  <li> The specialty has provided the Commission on Accreditation with specialty-specific postdoctoral educational and training guidelines endorsed by the Council of Specialties.</li> </ol> </li></ol>
<p><strong>Length of Program.</strong></p> <p>Each resident must complete a minimum of 1 year of full-time training in no less than 12 months (10 months for school psychology postdoctoral training programs), or 2 years of half-time training in no more than 24 months. Specialty practice residencies may require longer training periods, as specified in their respective education and training guidelines. </p>
<p><strong>Direct Service Delivery. </strong></p> <p>This is an essential element of training that promotes advanced competencies in health service psychology. Programs must allocate sufficient time to various training activities in order to promote the development of advanced competencies (e.g., direct service, didactics, supervision, and research). Programs that require substantial research activities must demonstrate how these research activities are directly related to the program's aims, competencies and outcomes as described in Standard II. </p>
<p><strong>Learning. </strong></p> <p>Learning must take precedence over service delivery. The program must demonstrate that residents' service delivery activities are primarily learning-oriented and that training considerations take precedence over service needs and revenue generation.</p>
<p><strong>Training Setting. </strong></p>  <p>The setting must be appropriate for the program's aims and the development of residents' advanced competencies. Resources to support training must be sufficient to meet the program's aims and various expected learning outcomes. The service population must be appropriate and sufficient to meet the direct service activities that foster development of advanced competencies.  </p>
<p><strong>Administrative Structure</strong></p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> The program's aims are consistent with the mission of the larger institution in which it resides.  The program is represented in the institution's operating budget and plans in a manner that enables it to achieve its aims.<br></li> <li> The administrative structure and processes facilitate systematic coordination, control, direction, and organization of the training activity and resources. <br></li> <li> A postdoctoral training program may consist of, or be located under, a single administrative entity (e.g., institution, agency, school, or department) or may take the form of a consortium. </li> </ol>
<p><strong>Administrative Responsibilities Related to Cultural and Individual Differences and Diversity.</strong></p>  <p>The program recognizes the importance of cultural and individual differences and diversity in the training of psychologists. The Commission on Accreditation defines cultural and individual differences and diversity as including, but not limited to, age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, language, national origin, race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. The program has made systematic, coherent, and long-term efforts to attract and retain residents and faculty/staff from diverse backgrounds into the program. Consistent with such efforts, it acts to ensure a supportive and encouraging learning environment appropriate for the training of individuals who are diverse and the provision of training opportunities for a broad spectrum of individuals. Further, the program avoids any actions that would restrict program access on grounds that are irrelevant to success in postdoctoral training, either directly or by imposing significant and disproportionate burdens on the basis of the personal and demographic characteristics set forth in the definition of cultural diversity. Because of the United States' rich diverse higher education landscape, training can take place in both secular and faith-based settings. Thus this requirement does not exclude programs from having a religious affiliation or purpose and adopting and applying admission and employment policies that directly relate to this affiliation or purpose, so long as public notice of these policies has been made to applicants, residents, and faculty/staff before their application or affiliation with the program. These policies may provide a preference for persons adhering to the religious purpose or affiliation of the program, but they shall not be used to preclude the admission, hiring, or retention of individuals because of the personal and demographic characteristics set forth under the definition of cultural diversity. This provision is intended to permit religious policies as to admission, retention, and employment only to the extent that they are protected by the U.S. Constitution. This provision will be administered as if the U.S. Constitution governed its application. Notwithstanding the above, and regardless of a program's setting, the program may not constrain academic freedom or otherwise alter the requirements of these standards. Finally, compelling pedagogical interests require that each program prepare residents to navigate cultural and individual differences in research and practice, including those that may produce value conflicts or other tensions arising from the intersection of different areas of diversity.</p>    <ol type="a" start="1">  <li> The program is an integral part of the mission of the institution in which it resides.<br></li>  <li> The administrative structure and processes facilitate systematic coordination, control, direction, and organization of the training activity and resources.</li>  </ol>
<p><strong>Funding and Budget Sources</strong></p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> A program must have stable and sufficient funding to conduct the training necessary to meet its aims. <br></li> <li> All postdoctoral residents must be financially supported at a level consistent with  comparable doctoral-level professionals training at the same site or in the region.</li> </ol>
<p><strong>Training Resources and Support Services. </strong></p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> The program provides sufficient and appropriate resources to fulfill the aims of the program (e.g., office space, supplies, computers, clerical support, library, and test equipment).<br></li> <li> These resources and facilities must be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. </li> </ol>
<p><strong>a. Resident Recruitment and Selection</strong></p>   <ol class="lower-roman" type="i" start="1"> <li> The program has procedures for resident selection that ensure residents are appropriately prepared for the training offered.<br></li> <li> At the initiation of training, residents will have completed doctoral and internship training in programs accredited by an accrediting body recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education or by the Canadian Psychological Association. If the program accepts residents who attended unaccredited programs, the residency must describe how the program ensures that selected residents are otherwise qualified and appropriately prepared for advanced training in the residency program.</li>  </ol>   <p><strong>b. Program Policies and Procedures. </strong></p> <p>The program has and adheres to, and makes available to all interested parties, formal written policies and procedures that govern residents as they enter and complete the program. These must include policies relevant to: </p>  <ol class="lower-roman" type="i" start="1"> <li> resident recruitment and selection; <br></li> <li> any required prior doctoral program and internship preparation and experiences; <br></li> <li> administrative and financial assistance; <br></li> <li> requirements for successful resident performance (including expected competencies and minimal levels of achievement for completion); <br></li> <li> resident  performance evaluation, feedback, retention, and termination decisions; <br></li> <li> identification and remediation of insufficient competence and/or problematic behavior, which shall include necessary due process steps of notice, hearing and appeal<br></li> <li> grievance procedures for residents including due process;<br></li> <li> supervision requirements; <br></li> <li> maintenance of records;<br></li> <li> documentation of non-discrimination policies and operating conditions and avoidance of any actions that would restrict program access or completion on grounds that are irrelevant to success in post-doctoral training or the profession. </li> </ol>
<p><strong>Resident Evaluation.  </strong></p> <p>Residents must receive written feedback on the extent to which they are meeting performance requirements at least semiannually (or more often as the need arises).</p>
<p><strong>Implementation. </strong></p> <p>All policies and procedures used by the program must be consistent with the profession's current ethics code and must adhere to the sponsor institution's regulations and local, state, and federal statutes regarding due process and fair treatment.

<p><strong>Aims of the Program.</strong></p> <p>The program must describe its aims in residency training (i.e., the overall, long-term expected outcome of the residency program).</p>
<p><strong>Competencies. </strong></p> <p>Postdoctoral programs ensure that residents attain advanced competencies relevant to the program's specialty or area of focus. Because science is at the core of health service psychology, programs must demonstrate that they rely on the current evidence base when training and assessing residents in the competency areas. All programs provide experiences to promote advanced competencies fundamental to health service psychology (Level 1). Additionally, programs ensure that residents attain advanced competencies relevant to the program's aims or area of focus (Level 2), or that are consistent with the program's designated specialty (Level 3).</p>  <p><strong>1. Level 1-Advanced Competency Areas Required of All Programs at the Postdoctoral Level</strong></p> <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> Integration of Science and Practice.

This includes issues of cultural and individual diversity relevant to advanced practice, as appropriate to the setting, the population served, and the focus or specialty area.<br></li> <li> Ethical and Legal. This includes professional conduct, ethics and law, and professional standards for providers of psychological services relevant to advanced practice, as appropriate to the setting, the population served, and the focus or specialty area.</li>  </ol>   <p><strong>2. Level 2-Program-Specific or Area of Focus Competencies</strong></p> <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> The program specifies expected learning outcomes appropriate and relevant for the area of health service psychology that is emphasized in training (i.e., residents' expected competencies upon program completion).<br></li> <li> The program requires all residents to demonstrate competencies at an advanced level in those domains integral to achieving its aims. These may include some or all CoA profession-wide competencies or other competencies identified by the program.</li>  </ol>   <p><strong>3. Level 3-Specialty Competencies.</strong></p> <p>To be accredited in a specialty practice area, the program must fulfill the standards for accreditation as well as the training and education guidelines endorsed by the recognized specialty. </p>
<p>A formal, goal-directed training plan describing planned training experiences must be developed for each resident. An individualized training plan should include the resident's level of competence at entry in planning for how he or she will successfully attain the program's exit criteria. The educational activities listed below may occur in an interprofessional context or may make use of existing didactics occurring in the setting if they are appropriate for an advanced level of training.  </p>
<p><strong>Educational Activities. </strong></p>  <p>(e.g. didactics, clinical conferences, grand rounds, group supervision). The program must demonstrate how structured educational activities complement experiential training and how they are linked to competencies in Levels 1-3 above.</p>

<p>1. Certain competencies are required for all interns who graduate from programs accredited in health service psychology. Programs must provide opportunities for all of their interns to achieve and demonstrate that each required profession-wide competency has been met.</p> <p>2. The role of the internship is to build upon a trainee's competencies in all of the competency areas. Because science is at the core of health service psychology, programs must demonstrate that they rely on the current evidence base when training and assessing interns in the competency areas. Interns must demonstrate competence in: </p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> Research<br></li> <li> Ethical and legal standards<br></li> <li> Individual and cultural diversity<br></li> <li> Professional values, attitudes, and behaviors<br></li> <li> Communication and interpersonal skills<br></li> <li> Assessment<br></li> <li> Intervention<br></li> <li> Supervision<br></li> <li> Consultation and interprofessional/interdisciplinary skills</li> </ol>
<p><strong>Specific Aims of the Training Program.</strong></p> <p>Consistent with profession-wide competencies required of all programs, the program must provide information on the specific aims of the training program. The program's aims should be aligned with the program's training activities and intended outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Program-Specific Competencies. </strong></p> <p>While internship programs accredited in health service psychology must encompass profession-wide competencies required of all programs, they may also elect to demonstrate program-specific competencies.</p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> The program must specify if its intended training outcomes will place special emphasis on the development of any competencies in addition to those expected for all psychology interns or to a greater degree of achievement than might be expected for all psychology interns.<br></li> <li> Additional competencies, if any, must be current and consistent with the definition of health service psychology, ethics of the profession, and aims of the program.</li>  </ol>
<p><strong>Educational Activities. </strong></p> <p>It is the responsibility of the program to have a clear and coherent plan for educational activities that support interns' achievement of both profession-wide and any program-specific competencies.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Elements </strong></p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> The program's primary training method must be experiential (i.e. service delivery in direct contact with service recipients) and include sufficient observation and supervision by psychologists to facilitate interns' readiness to enter into the general practice of psychology on training completion. <br></li> <li> The program must follow a logical training sequence that builds on the skills and competencies acquired during doctoral training. <br></li> <li> Training for practice must be sequential, cumulative, and graded in complexity in a manner consistent with the program's training structure.<br></li> <li> The program must demonstrate that intern service delivery tasks and duties are primarily learning-oriented and training considerations take precedence over service delivery and revenue generation.</li> </ol>
<p><strong>Supervision</strong></p>  <ol type="a" start="1"> <li> Supervision is regularly scheduled.<br></li> <li> Interns receive at least 4 hours of supervision per week. <br></li> <li> One or more doctoral level psychologists, who are appropriately trained and licensed, are involved in ongoing supervisory relationships with an intern and have primary professional responsibility for the cases on which supervision is provided. The supervisor(s) must conduct a total of at least 2 hours per week of individual supervision with the intern during the course of the year. <br></li> <li> Supervisory hours beyond the 2 hours of individual supervision must be consistent with the definition of supervision in the glossary, and must be supervised by health care professionals who are appropriately credentialed for their role/contribution to the program. These interactive experiences can be in a group or individual format.<br></li> <li> Interns should have access to consultation and supervision during times they are providing clinical services.<br></li> <li> The doctoral-level licensed psychologist supervisors maintain overall responsibility for all supervision, including oversight and integration of supervision provided by other professionals.</li> </ol>
<p><strong>Evaluation of Interns' Competencies</strong></p> Current Interns. As part of its ongoing commitment to ensuring the quality of its graduates, the program must evaluate intern in both profession-defined and program-defined competencies. By the end of the internship, each intern must demonstrate achievement of both the profession-wide competencies and any additional competencies required by the program. For each competency, the program must:   <ol class="lower-roman" type="i" start="1"> <li> specify how it evaluates intern performance;<br></li> <li> identify the minimum level of achievement or performance required of the intern to demonstrate competency;<br></li> <li> provide outcome data that clearly demonstrate all interns successfully completing the program have attained the minimal level of achievement of both the profession-wide and any program-specific competencies;<br></li> <li> base each intern evaluation in part on direct observation (either live or electronic) of the intern;<br></li> <li> While the program has flexibility in deciding what outcome data to present, the data should reflect assessment that is consistent with professionally accepted practices in intern competencies evaluation.</li>  </ol>
<p><strong>Internship Program Alumni. </strong></p> <p>The program must evaluate the functioning of alumni in terms of their career paths in health service psychology. Each program must provide data on how well the program prepared interns in each of the profession-wide and any program-specific competencies. The program must also provide data on interns' job placement and licensure status.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation of Program Effectiveness and Quality Improvement Efforts </strong></p>     <ol type="a" start="1">  <li> The program must demonstrate ongoing self-evaluation to monitor its performance to ensure competence in health service psychology and   contribute to fulfilment of its sponsor institution's mission. <br></li>  <li> The program must document mechanisms for engaging in regular, ongoing self-assessment that:</li>       <ol class="lower-roman" type="i" start="1">  <li> involves program stakeholders, including training faculty/staff, interns, program graduates, and others   involved in the training program;<br></li>  <li> evaluates its effectiveness in training interns who, by the completion of the internship, demonstrate competencies     required by the profession and the program, and who are able to engage in professional activities consistent with health service psychology and with the program's aims;  <br></li>  <li> has procedures in place to use proximal and distal data to monitor, make changes in, and improve the program;<br></li>  <li> provides resources and/or   opportunities to enhance the quality of its training and supervision faculty/staff through continual professional development;<br></li>  <li> evaluates the currency and  appropriateness of its aims, educational activities, policies and procedures with respect to its sponsor institution' mission and goals; local, state/provincial,  regional, and national needs for psychological services; national standards for health service psychology; and the evolving evidence base of the profession.</li>    </ol></ol>
